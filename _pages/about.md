I am from Chaoyang, Liaoning Province, and I am a member of the Communist Party of China. Since the first year of undergraduate study, the seeds of technology power buried in my heart began to sprout, and I bravely embarked on the journey of learning computer science and technology. I actively completed the classroom learning, including core knowledge such as data structure and programming language, which laid a solid foundation for my future study. I have a deep understanding of my pursuit. I want to change the world with technology. 

Professional Learning
------
In my freshman year, I also began to learn some programming languages and algorithms by myself. I practiced programming and learned data structures every day, striving for a more solid grasp in the basic stage. Although the weighted score of 90.34 in this academic year is not among the best, my technical ability has steadily improved.

The second year of undergraduate is the period when I began to study more deeply. I took some advanced courses, such as machine learning, verilog programming, fundamentals of computer systems, etc., and also audited advanced topics in machine learning for graduate courses to gain an in-depth understanding of cutting-edge technologies. In the continuous professional learning, I have established a more systematic understanding of my major. In the sophomore year, the weighted score was 92.84, especially in the second semester of the sophomore year, when I mainly studied professional courses, the weighted score was 94.55, and the number of courses such as Principles of computer composition, assembly language, signal and linear system reached 95+. At the same time, I was constantly broadening my horizon. Apply the knowledge learned to practice and lay a solid foundation for the future.

Rich discipline competition

At the same time, I was constantly broadening my horizon. Apply the knowledge learned to practice and lay a solid foundation for the future.
Since the freshman year, I have been learning machine learning and deep learning by myself, and I have been constantly making practice in the sophomore year. My achievements again and again have proved my footprints. Whether it is designing an end-to-end model to realize the mutual translation between different languages in IKCEST's Fourth "Belt and Road" International Big Data Competition, Helped countries along the Belt and Road to exchange, and finally won the international third prize; In the "micro hot spot" communication data mining competition, through the information tracing of hot events, "pulse tracing" for hot events, and finally won the silver award; Or in the China Software Cup College Student Program Competition, I designed and implemented Linge intelligent resume analysis system, helped the real workplace with artificial intelligence algorithms, and finally won the national first prize... Every achievement continues to inspire my faith, I believe that I can use artificial intelligence to help all aspects of social development, with their own strength to contribute to the development of science and technology of the motherland.

Start of Scientific Research
------
I hope to make achievements in artificial intelligence research. In today's era of large models, I pursue to learn cutting-edge technologies. In the summer vacation of my sophomore year, I became an open source contributor, completed the chatbot text robot service based on OpenEuler, and carried out research under the guidance of teacher He Kun, an AI research team. In the junior year, I carried out in-depth scientific research activities to explore the security problems of big language models. First, I studied the value alignment direction of big language models, engaged in in-depth research on the jailbreak attack of big language models, further studied the privacy security problems of big language models, and studied the security problems of LLM under the framework of federated segmentation learning. Using a large language model to detect code vulnerabilities and ensure code security, every scientific research makes me grow and determine my own ideals, hoping to deepen my work in the field of artificial intelligence and ensure that the field of artificial intelligence can benefit all aspects of life safely and effectively.

Student Work and Other Activities
------
In terms of student work, I had the courage to shoulder heavy responsibilities, became the monitor of computer class 2106, actively cared about classmates, organized academic leaders to join the class, and invited Professor Xie Changsheng to share; Organized and designed the class culture wall, which won unanimous praise. I also took an active part in the work of the school. As a student representative, I participated in the student congress of the school for many times, participated in the orientation activities of the School of Computer Science and Technology. I also had the honor to participate in the 50th anniversary of the construction of the computer science and technology major of the School of Computer Science. At the same time, as the backbone of the competition department of the College Students' Science and Technology Association, I also participated in the organization of science and technology festival activities for many times, and volunteered to serve in the 9th Qiushi Cup College students' Science and Technology Exhibition. In constant attempts and learning, I improved my work art.
